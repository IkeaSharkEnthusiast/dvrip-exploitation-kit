# xiongmai / dvrip exploitation
- this "loader" or "exploiter" leaks the credentials of a xiongmai dvr/nvr and then tries to execute a command on it.
- repository also contains a golang to interact with the devices which i have mostly written myself. not finished but it works.
   
# vulnerable?
to the cred leak over 100k - to the execution about ~30-50K
